- 👋 Hi, I’m @bertisLongfellow, a far-reaches-of-middle-aged guy who started out on a TI-99/4A, graduated to an Atari 130XL, then my first IBM-clone PC. Coding and hacking has always been a part of work and life, deep-dabbling around the ever-evolving technological garden.
- 👀 I’m currently deep-dabbling in SQL Server, ArcGIS Pro, Powershell and all things plain text.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that there is a heavy tension between deep-dabbling and delegation.
- 💞️ I’m too unskilled and unstructured to collaborate.
- 📫 I don't really think anyone wants to get in touch with me because of my GitHub account.
